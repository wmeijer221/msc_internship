# MSc Internship Sourcecode
Repository for sourcecode related to my master's research internship.

### Note:
Any script that interacts with an Atlas.ti project, expects it to be in the web format as reading it relies on the inner content files being html.
This repository does not contain any data itself, so contact the researchers if desired.
All used paths are hard-coded, so refer to the individual scripts for the used file locations.
